# CS370CurrentEmergingTrendsInCS
A repository for my work completed throughout my CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science course at Southern New Hampshire University

# Briefly explain the work that you did on this project

What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was given all of the code within the files 'GameExperience.py' and 'TreasureMaze.py' and I was given the majority of the code in the file 'Colton_Taylor_ProjectTwo.ipynb' outside of the TODO section. I implemented most of the code in the q_train() function, starting from setting the exporation factor to calculating the win rate.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists create software and design algorithms to effectively and strategically address real-world issues. Their contributions are crucial in forming the contemporary world as they power everything from infrastructure and healthcare to entertainment and education.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I begin by examining the problem's requirements and dividing it into smaller, more manageable tasks. I then use reasoning and iterative development to design, construct, and test a solution.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

It is my duty to make sure my code is dependable, safe, and considerate of user privacy. Transparency, inclusion, and fairness must be my top ethical priorities when developing systems that support the objectives of the company without sacrificing the rights or welfare of the final user.
